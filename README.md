# NLP-Sentiment-Analysis Group 12
This project compares 2023 vs. 2024 by analyzing sentiment shifts in Apollo Global Managementâ€™s 10-K filings and wording changes in GitHub project descriptions. Using NLP techniques, we track tone, risk disclosures, and strategic shifts in financial reports, while text analysis uncovers evolution in project messaging and terminology over time.
