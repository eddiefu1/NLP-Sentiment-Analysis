# NLP-Sentiment-Analysis: Group 12 Apollo Global Management 
## Eddie Fu, Pinrui Su, Qilong Yu, Xinyang Gao

This project compares 2023 vs. 2024 by analyzing sentiment shifts in Apollo Global Management’s 10-K filings. Using NLP techniques, we track tone, risk disclosures, and strategic shifts in financial reports, while text analysis uncovers evolution in project messaging and terminology over time.


This study addresses the above gaps by answering five key questions:  

Automated financial report analysis: Automatically identify and extract the content of different chapters in the 10-K report (such as "Item 1A. Risk Factors", "Item 1. Business", "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis") to solve the tedious problem of manually searching and organizing the report directory.

Text preprocessing and cleaning: Standardize the extracted text, such as word segmentation, stop word removal, word form restoration, etc., to ensure that subsequent analysis can be carried out on the basis of clean and consistent data.

Keyword and context extraction: Extract the context of keywords (such as "risk", "income", "AUM"), count the frequency of related words, and reveal the company's description, focus and emphasis in specific areas.

Sentiment analysis and quantitative evaluation: Use sentiment analysis tools (such as VADER) to score the extracted keywords and their context positively and negatively, and obtain the overall sentiment index through weighted calculation, so as to quantify the company's tone and attitude in risk disclosure, profit description, etc.

Cross-year comparative analysis: Compare reports from different years (e.g. 2023 and 2024) to capture changes in management’s descriptions of risk, profitability, asset management, etc., helping users identify trends and strategic adjustment signals
